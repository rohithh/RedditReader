Hi There!
Welcome to Rohith's Reddit Reader!
Here you have the functionality to view subreddits by just typing in their name.

Instructions :

1. To view the application - Go to this URL, it is hosted here : https://reddit-reader-rohithh.c9users.io/Reddit-Reader.html
The source root directory of the hosting is here : https://reddit-reader-rohithh.c9users.io/

2. To view a new subreddit : Enter name of subreddit and number of posts you want to see. Then press "Click me to see subreddits". Yes its that simple!

3. To delete a subreddit from the viewer, simply go to the subreddit that you want to remove, and click the red 'x' button! Bet you got that one right!

That besides, the subreddits show the votes and comments on them. The ones that are fetched are the same ones that a user would see when s/he navigates to the subreddit through the browser. This way the user has the latest and most updated subreddits. The subreddits that appear on the url can be clicked on and navigated to.

Please Note :

1. The news subreddit is default and cant be removed
 
2. Sometimes, the Reader will not update after adding a subreddit, in this case, please try typing into any of the input boxes below
 
3. The same item added more than once will not update the Reader
